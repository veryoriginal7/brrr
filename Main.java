        7b.) because we can send code to each other and add that code to a project
        7C.) A commit is a like a picture or a spawnpoint of a code that you can't chaange, you can add that to your branch
        7D.)idk
        7E.) Idk
        7F.)you can make a copy of your code, then merge it back to the main branch.
